Required for polarization and movement of myocardializing cells in the outflow tract and seems to act via RHOA signaling to regulate this process. Required for cell surface localization of FZD3 and FZD6 in the inner ear (By similarity)"kmeans,3,Dark Cyan,20,ZBTB33,9606.ENSP00000314153,Transcriptional regulator Kaiso; Transcriptional regulator with bimodal DNA-binding specificity. Binds to methylated CpG dinucleotides in the consensus sequence 5'-CGCG-3' and also binds to the non-methylated consensus sequence 5'-CTGCNA-3' also known as the consensus kaiso binding site (KBS). Recruits the N-CoR repressor complex to promote histone deacetylation and the formation of repressive chromatin structures in target gene promoters. May contribute to the repression of target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway. May also activate transcription of a subset of target genes by the re [...] kmeans,3,Dark Cyan,20,WNT11,9606.ENSP00000325526,Protein Wnt-11; Ligand for members of the frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors.
